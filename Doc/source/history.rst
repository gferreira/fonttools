History
=======

The fontTools project was started by Just van Rossum in 1999, and was
maintained as an open source project at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/. In 2008, Paul Wise (pabs3)
began helping Just with stability maintenance. In 2013 Behdad Esfahbod
began a friendly fork, thoroughly reviewing the codebase and making
changes at https://github.com/behdad/fonttools to add new features and
support for new font formats.
